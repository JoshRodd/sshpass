# sshpass 1.06-brew

This is sshpass 1.06 as it existed on SourceForge on 25 Mar. 2017.

It has an addition with a HomeBrew .rb file so it can easily be
installed with HomeBrew, and also has an archive available on public
GitHib that can be downloaded without needing to navigate through
various pages of advertisements like SourceRorge requires.

The .rb file was based on the one original retrieved from the
location listed below which linked to SourceForge and was based on
1.05:
